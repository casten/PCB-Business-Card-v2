# PCB Business Card v2
This repository serves as a finished copy of my second PCB business card with certain personal data scrubbed. Feel free to utilize the included files as a template or guide for your own design!

KiCAD files require KiCAD v8.0+

Read more about the design intentions and processes of this business card on the accompanying [blog post](https://www.laplacier.com/pcb-business-card)

## Compiling the code
1. Download the [ch32v003fun](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun) library
2. Insert the CH32V003 code folder into the ch32v003fun/examples folder (this corrects the file paths).
3. Follow the up-to-date instructions on [ch32v003fun](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun) on how to build and flash the code.
